      <h3><li>Crafts</li></h3>
      <p>
        I most enjoy making crafts on my free time, it could go all the way from
        making origami bookmarks to breaking down a closet and making new
        shelves and decor pieces out of it!
      </p>

      <h3><li>Video games</li></h3>
      <p>
        I like spending time "digitally" with my friend by playing video games
        together! My favourite video game is Dota2 (despite the fact that i'm
        actually not that goot at it lol)
      </p>

      <h3><li>Painting</li></h3>
      <p>
        I love to paint because it calms me down. It isn't necessarily a van
        gough master piece but just the proccess of painting is what i enjoy.
        This also varies from painting on walls to painting on my nails!
      </p>

      <h3><li>Reading</li></h3>
      <p>
        I'm still new to this but what i like most about it is that i could get
        lost in my imagination and not norice that i've spent half of my day
        just holding a book!
